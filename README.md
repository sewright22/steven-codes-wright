I've decided to use a monorepo for my personal projects. This is the root of that repo.

I believe this approach will help me to keep my projects more organized and easier to maintain. 
I also believe it will help me to keep my projects more consistent in terms of code style and structure, along with allowing me to more easily
share GitHub pipelines.

I have added solution filters (.slnf) to the root of each project. This is to allow me to easily open a single project in Visual Studio.
