You'll need to name your bracket. It can be anything, but remember, there are a lot of us in the pool so having some type of identifier is recommended and encouraged!

Repeat until you've got all your Picks picked!

You'll see your completed bracket under the "Completed Brackets" section on the home screen. You can use the "Create Another Bracket" button to create as many brackets as you want,
but remember - you'll need to pay Professor Paul for each one!
